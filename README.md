# Objectives
* To display the time or the temperature & humidity, packed in a LEGO Â® case.

## Solution
### Display
* the time hours & minutes in HH:mm 24h format.
* the temperature (Deg C) and Humidity (%RH).
* uses 4-Digits in red.
### Infrared Remote Control to set Mode
* [Button n] = [Mode]
* Button 1 = Display Time.
* Button 2 = Display Temperature + Humidity. No digits.
* Button 3 = Display Temperature with 2 digits.
* Button 4 = Display Humidity with 2 digits.
* Button 5 = Set Hours.
* Button 6 = Set Minutes.
* Button 7 = Set Brightness.
* Button 8 = Turn display on / off.
* Button 9 = N/A.
* Button - = Decrease Hours, Minutes, Brightness depending mode.
* Button + = Increase Hours, Minutes, Brightness depending mode.
_Notes_
* When powering on, the default time is 19:58. Set the time by pressing button 5 for hours and button 6 for minutes.
* Ensure to press button 1 after completing settings via buttons 5 - 9 and -/+.

### Creation Rules
* Use as microcontroller an Arduino UNO or compatible.
* Use standard LEGO bricks.
* Minimize LEGO brick modifications.
* LEGO Case with modular components.
* Build code with B4R.

## Hardware Parts (approx cost EUR)
* 1x Arduino UNO (8 EUR)
